**NIEM 4.0 in Java**

The National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) is a community-driven, common 
vocabulary that enables efficient information exchange across diverse public 
and private organizations. NIEM can save time and money by providing consistent, 
reusable data terms and definitions and repeatable processes.

NIEM is distributed as a set of XML stylesheets (XSD) files. 
This is a compilation of the complete NIEM 4.0 release. 

**What is NIEM?**

Think of NIEM as a dictionary of agreed-upon terms, definitions, relationships, 
and formats that are independent of how information is stored in individual 
systems. The NIEM model includes community-specific elements, as well as core 
elements that are commonly agreed to by the communities who use NIEM. 
For example, common elements in the NIEM core include “person,” “location,” 
“item,” “organization,” and “activity.”

**NIEM is a foundation to build information exchanges**

NIEM provides rules and methodologies around the use of the model as well as 
a standardized Information Exchange Development Lifecycle that can be reused 
by everyone. 

# About this library

NIEM is a as a dictionary of data format. The utility of NIEM is that a subset of
dictionary "entries" can be encapsulated into a "package" and the package can 
then be used to encode and exchange information in a standardized format.

This library is the complete NIEM 4.0 dictionary. It probably contains much more
than you will need for your particular data exchange application. If you are 
building an application where efficiency and size are important then you should
probably follow the NIEM model and build your information exchange package.

On the other hand, this library also probably contains everything you will need
to build an information exchange message protocol. If you are building a 
cloud-based application with resources-a-plenty, then the efficiency of 
customization is probably not worth the hassle and this library is the right
solution.

# Versioning

The major and minor version of this library will always be "4.0" to indicate 
compatibility with the underlying NIEM specification. The patch version will 
be incremented as appropriate.
